## Project Overview

This project focuses on the stability analysis of telecommunication towers to identify structural issues and potential instabilities. Utilizing computer vision and integrating various sensors, this system aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of tower conditions.

## Project Stages

### 1. Problem Analysis and Objectives

- Analyze the stability of telecommunication towers to detect potential structural problems and instabilities.
- Implement computer vision techniques alongside multiple sensors to assess the tower's condition effectively.

### 2. Data Collection

- Gather data through cameras and various sensors including:
  - **Gyroscope Sensors**: To measure changes in orientation.
  - **Accelerometers**: For detecting movement and vibrations.
  - **Anemometers**: To measure wind speed.
  - **Pressure/Force Sensors**: To detect external stresses on the tower.
- Combine the data from sensors with images for a more precise analysis.

### 3. Image Processing and Feature Detection

- Apply preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality (noise reduction, contrast enhancement).
- Identify and extract significant features from images, such as edges and lines.
- Conduct comparative analyses of images taken at different times to monitor changes.

### 4. Data Integration

- Achieve a detailed assessment of tower conditions by merging data from various sensors and images.
- For example, correlate angular changes detected by the gyroscope with data from wind sensors, laser leveling, and images to identify signs of structural instability.

## Output

The outcome is a sophisticated software and hardware system capable of analyzing both visual and sensor data to detect potential structural problems and instabilities in telecommunication towers. The system aims to improve the safety and reliability of telecommunication infrastructure significantly.
